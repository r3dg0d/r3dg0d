- 👋 Hi, I’m @r3dg0d
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, machine learning, big data, and conversational virtual assistants, as well as hacking, cybersecurity and infrastructure, and 3D Imaging data / Mapping with AI enabled devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in javascript, python, and other basic scripting languages, as well as applying cybersecurity, and using 3D visualization software. My biggest project right now is an Iron Man Helmet and full-suit, using magic leap and microcomputers. Microcomputers running windows are the future of computer and technological development, and Big Data will enable fully conversational AI as well as imaging and intelligent computer systems. The time is now.
- 🥚 My natural year is 2002, this is my birth year, I am born from planet Earth. I like to stay optimistic about the future of mankind. Assisting mankind in one dimension assists it in every dimension. Keep doing what you do best. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for other programmers and smart people to collaborate with online. If you have an idea or want to work together, then send me a message and I *might* respond.
