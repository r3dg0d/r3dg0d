- 👋 Hi, I’m @r3dg0d
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, machine learning, big data, and conversational virtual assistants, as well as hacking and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in javascript, python, and other basic scripting languages, as well as applying cybersecurity, and using 3D visualization software. My biggest project right now is building a rocket ship with a 3D Printer, as well as experimental fuels, and loading stuff onto said spaceship. Testing net-weight and zero-G. In theory Gravity isn't real, just the force of the Universe.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my github repos.
