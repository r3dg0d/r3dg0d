- 👋 Hi, I’m @r3dg0d
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, machine learning, big data, and conversational virtual assistants, as well as hacking and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in javascript, python, and other basic scripting languages, as well as applying cybersecurity, and using 3D visualization software. My biggest project right now is building a rocket ship with a 3D Printer, as well as working with experimental fuels and rocket chemistry, and testing human crash dummies. Testing net-weight and zero-G. In theory Gravity isn't real, just the force of the the center of the universe. The Earth is 100% round though lmfao. My repositories are a way of me keeping and storing ideas for large-scale projects that I work on. I know that in the next 10 years technology is gonna advance so fast that its good to keep advancing with it, so I update the repositories from time to time to add new code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for other programmers and smart people to collaborate with online. If you have an idea or want to work together, then send me a message and I *might* respond.
